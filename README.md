### LETS MAKE BAGELS 
This app calculates how much of each ingredient you need for a bagel recipe.


As someone who is passionate about health and wellness, but also deeply in love with carbs, I came up with a recipe for protein bagels! 
I'm talking massive, yummy, and surprisingly healthy. These bagels pack 42 grams of protein each, and will only run you about 200 calories! 
I have been making these weekly for myself, and when I first started learning to code, I had gotten tired of pulling out my calculator and figuiring out the recipe for how many bagels I wanted to make on that given week. 
That frustration inspired me to make this simple app that calulcates the recipe to make however many bagels your heart desires. 

This was the very first app I made when I started coding, and although I have moved on to making bigger and better things, this is the app I've made that I use the most!

ðŸ’¡Baker's tip: I like to add a light coat of egg wash and top these with extras like everything bagel seasoning, jalapenos and cheddar, or even cinnamon! Bake at 350 for 21 minutes.
